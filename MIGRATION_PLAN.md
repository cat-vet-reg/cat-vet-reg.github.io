Intention
In this document I am going to write the migration plan from ReactJS to ANgular.

What I wish for you to do:
Create a new folder named castramap-angular and init a new angular project using the CLI on my machine. Migrate all of the react files into a new angular files using the best practices of angular. 


Rules:
* It is super improtant to separate the HTML from TypeScript and style so for every component I need to have tree diferent files intio a folder named like the files.
* Use only standalone components for angular.
* I hate Tailwind please intorduce the nesesary CSS files for the components.

The end result needs to be the same as the react app.
